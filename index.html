			 	<h3>Dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself. I was 3 years old when I started dancing. I liked it so much I wanted to go everyday of the week.We dance for physical fitness. We dance for mental clarity. We dance for emotional stability, and other such pluses. However, all these benefits could be attained by others means, though I confess I have yet to find a better alternative than a great cha cha to lift both one's heart-rate and spirits.</h3>
